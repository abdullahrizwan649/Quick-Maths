HELLO THERE!

This is my attempt at a little math game in Android Studio.

The game displays random mathematical questions and the user has to enter an answer

Points are awarded for every correct answer :)

THE BORING STUFF :/

The Minimum SDK is API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop). It will run on 98.8% of android devices.

FIRST ATTEMPT AT A PROJECT IN ANDROID STUDIO while working at KALSOFT :)
