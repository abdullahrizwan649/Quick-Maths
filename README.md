HELLO THERE!

This is my attempt at a little math game in Android Studio.

The game displays random mathematical questions and the user has to decide if the answer is correct or not.

Points are awarded for every correct answer and there's a timer, so WATCH OUT;)

THE BORING STUFF :/

The application is made using JAVA . 

The Minimum SDK is API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop). It will run on 98.8% of android devices.

FIRST ATTEMPT AT A PROJECT IN ANDROID STUDIO while working at KALSOFT :)
